## EasyList

[![Get it on Google Play][google_play_button]][google_play]

**EasyList** is a mobile application that allows the user to make shopping lists:
- Create shopping list
- Insert/Delete/Update list items
- Add photos of the product items. The user would take an item snapshot while being in the market, if heâ€™d want to do it, to remember the brand, characteristics of the list item.

The main idea is to keep the app as simple as possible. Therefore, no notifications, no alerts, no integration with other apps, geo location, just pure and simple custom lists.
